# Car Prices Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis of car prices using Python, aimed at understanding the factors influencing car pricing and predicting future trends. The notebook explores datasets, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applies machine learning models to analyze and predict car prices effectively.

## Project Overview

The project covers:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant columns.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key trends, relationships, and insights from the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting features to enhance model performance.

## Features

- **EDA Visualizations**: Scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and distribution graphs.
- **Insights**: Key takeaways on what factors impact car prices most.
